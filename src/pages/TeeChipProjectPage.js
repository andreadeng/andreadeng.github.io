            The Brief

          <Paragraph>
            TeeChip is a platform for selling custom products 
            by leveraging crowd funding and social media. 
            Users launch campaigns to sell custom products and 
            TeeChip handles the production and distribution of 
            the products, as well as the customer service associated 
            with any order placed on their site.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Since launching in 2014, TeeChip has reached a point 
            where it needed a complete overhaul to cater to its 
            growing seller base and pay down product debt.

          <Paragraph>
            I led the design process from user research to implementation 
            to build a new seller dashboard experience. I worked
            closely with Raymond Lei, the founder and CEO of the 
            company, sellers, and four engineers to 
            re-imagine the selling experience. The new TeeChip seller 
            dashboard and buyer experience, coined TeeChip Pro, 
            launched globally on April, 2017.

            Get to know the community

          <Paragraph>
            To kick off the design process I got connected to sellers 
            through our TeeChip seller support team. I interviewd over 
            20 sellers about the seller experience. I also looked at their 
            storefronts and campaigns and noted  
            patterns from what they chose to feature to how they position 
            the product. I learned most of the sellers were males in their 20s 
            living in Vietnam who hustled. They were
            aggressively promoting and selling their products and hopping from our platform 
            to ours competitors based on promos and deals.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            I learned TeeChip sellers are not interested in dealing with store 
            setup and complicated e-commerce systems. They want a simple 
            way to set up an online store and start marketing their products 
            to the world immediately.

              The new design for the seller dashboard needed 
              to have the capacity to grow with the company. In order to 
              achieve this, I focused on creating a consistent design 
              language and working with an engineer to implement 
              it into a scalable system that would make building additional 
              features in the future faster and in line with existing guidelines.

                Sellers are constantly trying to figure out what is selling successfully. 
                Big picture analytics about when sales are higher can provide a lot of insight 
                as to when to release ads. Specific campaign and storefront level analytics 
                provide insight into how one campaign may be doing better. The analytics also 
                encourage sellers to experiment more with descriptions, images, and more variations.

              <Paragraph>
                The goal of the analytics is to help sellers make decisions which items they should invest their time.
