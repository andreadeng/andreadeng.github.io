                In just three years since 2014, Scalable Press had 
                evolved from a small screen print service to a 
                national fulfillment network. By 2017, 1 in 6 people 
                in the U.S. owned a shirt printed by the SF-based startup.
              </Paragraph>
              <Paragraph>
                The Scalable Press website where customers manage 
                their orders and invoices, struggled to scale 
                with the company’s rapid growth. Tacked on 
                features competed for focus and inconsistent 
                interfaces hindered future development.

              <Paragraph>
                The redesign of Scalable Press web is 
                about creating a design system for our web experience 
                which would present all of our features as a
                powerful, quality platform.

              I led the Scalable Press web app re-design from May to August 2017 to address usability issues and establish design patterns that enable future projects to be easily built with speed and quality. I owned the design process from User Research to implementation and collaborated with another designer on the Home page. In addition, I worked alongside 3 Full Stack Engineers and a Product Manager who joined near the end of the project.

              and sales interviews from the past few months, we organized
              the pain points into three overarching themes to guide
              our endeavor.

                During our brainstorming sessions, we realized that
                many of the problems in Scalable Press web was the lack
                of a source of truth.

              <Paragraph>
                We had been discussing the need for a design system
                as our list of features and products were growing.
                The Scalable Press web redesign posed an
                opportunity to drive design system creation and testing.

                We set out to create a roadmap to define the system’s 
                direction without drowning in detail. After 
                doing a UI inventory of Scalable Press web, 
                we organized them by importance.

                Coding out the design system really forced me to think

                Insights from V1 from user testing with engineers, designers, 
                marketing was the need to know when to use what component. 
                WHEN TO USE WHAT COMPONENT???!?!?!

                While the master Sketch file was great for copying and 
                pasting assets, the interaction rules and best practices 
                for each component was still tribal knowledge within the team. 
                Soon, the design team encountered many questions around small 
                implementation details from the engineer teams, which 
                required every use case to be accounted for.

                To help design more efficiently with engineering, 
                I began working on the second version of the design 
                system which has much more detailed documentation for each UI pattern.

                A startup means you have to make hard calls. You have

                We learnt this balance— while still sticking to 
                quality. It worked well because people responded 
                to our difference in quality.
