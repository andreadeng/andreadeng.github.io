            &nbsp;is a San Francisco based fulfillment startup revolutionizing 
            the printing industry. Scalable Press web streamlines the 
            fulfillment process for users from placing orders to paying 
            invoices. However, it became increasingly clear through user 
            research that something was missing from this experience.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            We learned that behind customer inquiries of the order 
            status was a bigger problem. The problem was users were 
            unaware of order issues such as low resolution artwork or 
            incorrect print colors until they learned that their order 
            was delayed. By that time, not only was it too late to fix 
            the issue, there was no system in place for users to make 
            changes to the order. The goal of building the On Hold System 
            was to reduce order delays by catching issues early in 
            the process and enabling users to fix them.

            I led the design process end-to-end. I uncovered the 
            problem we were solving, worked with the PM to identify 
            the goal and scope of the project, and collaborated with 
            2 engineers early on. I also worked with the stakeholders, 
            sales reps, the VP of sales, engineering, and PM, 
            throughout to uncover more about user needs.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            This project was given a tight timeline of 2 months 
            from user research to release. In addition, there was 
            no existing design language as the team was simultaneously 
            building the Scalable Press Design System. Given the 2 
            month timeline, the engineers had to begin implementation 
            as I was working on the third iteration of the solution.

              <Paragraph>
                Collaborating with the sales team enabled me to learn 
                as much as possible about user needs. I spent a whole 
                day at the Fremont sales office, talking to all 12 
                sales reps. By doing so, I learned that the biggest 
                customer inquiry was “Where is my order?” In fact, 
                according to our April 2017 customer inquiry report 
                of 48% of customer inquiries were asking what the order 
                status was, 27% was asking to change the shipping address 
                or method, and only 20% was to price quoting, 5% other. 
                This was my starting point for user research.
              </Paragraph>
              <Paragraph>
                My initial hypothesis was:&nbsp;
                <Span primary italic strong>
                  “If we made the Events Feed feature more granular, 
                  users would use it to inform their customers.”&nbsp; 
                </Span>
                I thus set out to discover why users didn’t use the Events 
                Feed and what they used instead.

                Our two main users are sales reps from promotional

                the PM to interview 10 users from each group with me 
                and learned:

            After asking the engineers to do a data query of reasons for 
            order delays, I also learned that 80% of the issues could 
            be caught and resolved early. Thus, I learned my initial 
            hypothesis was incorrect. I learned that preventing order 
            delays was more important than being informed about them.

          <Paragraph>
            I learned that issue resolution on the Orders page was intrusive. 
            It took up a lot of vertical space, obscurring the orders list
            especially when the list of issues grew. Resolving issues and 
            viewing orders requires different intentions but were inappropriately 
            fused in the same view. Separated from the order it referenced, each issue message did not 
            provide enough context for users to take action. As a result, I decided to I explored ways to present 
            issue resolution in its order context.

            I first tested a prototype of (B) which presents order issues 
            as separate part of the page with expandable sections of 
            more information. However, after testing the prototype 
            with 5 of our users, I learned that it was not prominent 
            enough and felt disconnected from the affected products. 
            After further critique from the other product designer and 
            PM, I decided to test a prototype of (D) which proved to better 
            communicate which issue affected which products, something I 
            didn’t realize was important for users initially. However, it 
            was not clear to users that “View details” will allow them to 
            fix the issue. I looked into clearly communicating how users 
            can fix orders in later iterations.

              <Paragraph>
                For the On Hold System, I’ve added an “In review” 
                step to the fulfillment process to catch issues early on. Orders that 
                pass the review process will enter fulfillment and orders with issues will 
                be marked "On Hold".
              </Paragraph>
              <Paragraph>
                The final interaction includes a nonintrusive but clear 
                indication of orders with issues with the use of "On Hold" 
                and "Partially On Hold" status labels. The On Hold issue is also 
                introduced in context of which part of the order is affected. 
                This way, users can see at first glance, what the issue is 
                and which products are affected. Additional new features 
                such as the ability to edit the shipping address 
                and method gives users a sense of flexibility and control when 
                handling order issues.
              </Paragraph>
              <Paragraph>
                The new On Hold System was also the first new feature to use the

              From this project, I learned how important it is to 
              ask the right questions before diving into design. 
              Instead of just improving the Events Feed feature, 
              we provided greater value to users by reducing the 
              number of delayed orders. Involving engineers, sales, 
              and PM early on was also crucial in understanding 
              technical constraints and business goals upfront and 
              exploring a variety of solutions. I learned that stakeholders 
              can be a great resource for user needs if I filter through 
              biased perspectives. I also learned that hustling to get 
              feedback early and often reduces time working in the wrong 
              direction. This is what enabled us to launch the system 
              in 2 months time and see immense success.
