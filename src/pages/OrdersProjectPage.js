            &nbsp; is a San Francisco based fulfillment 
            startup revolutionizing the printing industry. Users use Scalable Press 
            web to place custom orders and pay invoices. However, the  
            Order status provided on the website is inaccurate and incomprehensive and 
            users learn about order delays from angry customers. 
            Our original approach was to provide users with comprehensive 
            order status updates. After user research and testing, however, we 
            saw a larger opportunity in building an 
            Order on hold and resolution flow to reduce order delays.

                The current Events Feed feature allows users to see where an order is 
                in the fulfillment process but isn't used because it's incomprehensive.
                My initial hypothesis was:&nbsp;
                <Span primary italic strong>
                  “If we made the Events Feed feature more granular, 
                  users would use it to inform their customers about order status.” &nbsp; 
                </Span>
                I thus set out to discover why users didn’t use the Events Feed and what they used instead.

                being informed about them.
                With that in mind, I recruited the engineers and Director of Customer Service to
                brainstorm.

          <Paragraph>
            I learned that issue resolution on the Orders page was intrusive. 
            It took up a lot of vertical space, obscurring the orders list
            especially when the list of issues grew. Resolving issues and 
            viewing orders requires different intentions but were inappropriately 
            fused in the same view. Separated from the order it referenced, each issue message did not 
            provide enough context for users to take action. As a result, I decided to I explored ways to present 
            issue resolution in its order context.

            After testing out a prototype, I learned that having issue resolution on the order details page 
            was more intuitive for users and in line with current workflow. However, 
            there was disconnect between issue and the affected part of the order. After feedback and critique, 
            I decided to test a prototype of (C), which proved to better integrate with users' existing workflow.

              With the new On Hold System, some orders will be marked 
              “On hold” or “Partially on hold” meaning we caught an 
              issue with the package. “On hold” packages are not fulfilled 
              unless the issues are resolved. This reduces the 
              percentage of late orders and offloads work from sales 
              to customers to make the changes necessary for the 
              hold to be removed.

              After launching the On Hold system, order delays decreased by 
              30%. Our sales team also shared with us the positive 
              feedback they received from customers regarding the new system. 
              From this project, I learned how important it is to ask the right questions 
              before diving into design. Instead of just improving the Order status feature, 
              we provided greater value to users by reducing the number 
              of delayed orders. Involving engineers, sales, and PM 
              early on was also crucial in understanding technical constraints and
              business goals upfront and exploring a variety of solutions. This 
              is what enabled us to launch the system in 2 months time and see 
              immense success.
